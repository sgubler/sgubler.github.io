In December 2016 I decided to surprise my wife with a soda fountain in our basement. I found a good deal on a classifieds site for locals where I live and made the jump. After purchasing the equipment I quickly found out I was in way over my head! So my good deal turned into a semi-okay deal. I decided to save myself a lot of headache and mistakes by hiring a local company to come out to my house and install the machine. In an effort to make the most of the money I spent getting the soda machine installed I asked the installer every question that came to mind and wanted to know exactly what he was doing. I'm sure this came across as being super obnoxious but he was very kind and shared a lot of his knowledge with me.

Fast forwarding a couple years, I have replaced my initial machine. I have purchased a next home and installed that machine in a new location. I've gotten into kegging and force carbonation. I'm starting to design some IoT devices for monitoring soda equipment (more to come at a later time). I have been asked by family and friends to help them find and install machines in their own homes. All of this has been a long learning experience and has been a lot of fun. 

Trying to follow the example of the first installer that helped answer all of my questions I am setting up this site. Hopefully it can become a resource for others looking to better celebrate Soda Life! I've also found other uses for CO<sub>2</sub> along my journey so I may share those as well.

Please enjoy!
